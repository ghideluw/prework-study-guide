      <h2>HTML</h2>
  <ul>
      <li>the html opening tag, represents the root, or start, of our HTML document.</li>
      <li>Inside the html tag is an attribute of lang="en", which tells the browser the language for the webpage (in this case, en for English).</li>
      <li>An HTML attribute defines additional information about an element. They are defined in the beginning of the element and not the closing element.</li> 
      <li>the !DOCTYPE html declaration tells the browser what document type it should expect when it is opened. This declaration is letting the browser know to expect HTML on the page. This declaration is not case sensitive.</li>
      <li>The head element in this case defines the following three elements:
      <li>The charset element sets our character encoding.</li>
      <li>The http-equiv element sets an HTTP header for content.</li>
      <li>The viewport element sets the default view for our webpage.</li>
      <li>The title element defines the title for a webpage. This element is required and is extremely important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).</li>     
      <li>The style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.
      <li>The base element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li> 
      <li> The link element connects an external resource to the HTML document. </li> 
      <li>The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
      <li>The script element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>

   </ul>

    
    
<ul>
<li>The boody element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
<li>All the elements that we want the user to see and interact with must be placed inside this element.</li>
<li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements. If there are three elements nested inside of a body element, those three nested elements are known as child elements. The element that holds all the children—in this case, the body element—is known as the parent element.</li>
<li>The body element is an example of a semantic HTML element. In semantic HTML elements, the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage. When possible, it is important to use semantic HTML elements, because they make your HTML easier to read by other developers and the browser.HTML also plays an important role in making sure your webpage is accessible to the widest variety of users, including those who use assistive technologies such as screen readers.</li>
<li>Not all elements are semantic, though. It is still common to see non-semantic elements such as div to create a division in the page, or span to create an inline division.</li>
<li>When working with visible HTML elements, the content is contained between an opening tag and a closing tag. These tags are represented by angle brackets with associated tag names contained inside. Closing tags begin with a forward slash.We insert the content between an opening tag and a closing tag so that the browser understands how to treat the contentrtant thing to keep in mind is that it is best practice to use semantic elements whenever possible, especially when the content is visible to users.</li>
<li>The h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6 elements  displayed within angle brackets represent the level of heading a given text block represents. Headings are exactly what they sound like: larger or more prominent titles and subtitles to organize a page.</li>     
<li>The p element within angle brackets represents a paragraph or block of text. You'll use this element extensively to wrap most of the text on your webpages.</li>
<li>The ul, ol, and li elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items. In essence, these HTML elements represent bulleted or numbered lists.</li>
<li>The img element in angled brackets contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage. The img element can contain various attributes; the src attribute is the most important because it defines the location of the image</li>
<li>The br element in angled brackets creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content. </li>
<li>the a element in angled brackets (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages. The href attribute within it points to the URL for the link</li>

        <h3>CSS</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
        <li>When a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file, they use inline CSS.Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only.</li> 
        <li>They’re useful for quick and permanent changes but are less flexible than external and internal style sheets, because each inline style must be edited individually whenever you make a design change.</li>
        <li>An example of inline CSS is using the style attribute to change the color of a single h1 heading.</li>

        <li>It is also possible to embed an entire stylesheet directly in the HTML file using a style element in the head element.</li>
        <li>This internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file.</li>
        <li>The rules only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and IDs, which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code.</li> 
        <li>Again, a single change to the CSS rule will apply to all tagged page elements.</li> 
        <li>The most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet.</li>
        <li>This is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
        <li>When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a link element placed in the HTML's head</li>
        <li>To incorporate a CSS rule, a selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
        <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
        <li>For example, the declaration color: blue; includes the CSS property color and the value for that property, blue.</li>
        
        </ul>
       
        <ul>
         
          <li>A margin property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>The margin is not visible on the page; it merely adds a buffer. When we set the margin property to 0, we are indicating that we want NO extra space around the element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>When you increase padding, you are actually making the entire element bigger! That is because the padding, while transparent, is located inside the element, whereas the margin is the transparent buffer outside an element.</li>
          <li>Sometimes, we want to apply a rule to all the elements visible on the page. To do that, we use a special wild card symbol, or *.</li>
          <li>we can combined two selectors into a single CSS rule with a comma, allowing the declarations to affect both selectors. </li>
          <li>Rather than repeating a rule which would add more lines of code and repetition, two or more elements that will share the same styling can be grouped together. This helps us write Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) code.</li>
          <li>The img selector assigns property values to any image element in the markup.</li>
          <li>The display property is assigned with the block value, which assigns each image to start on a new line.</li>
        
        </ul>

   <h4>GIT</h4>
   <ul>
    <li>Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of each version of your project.</li>
    <li>To access Git, we use the command line. However, Git commands are not the same as the bash commands such as cd and mkdir that we use to navigate and create directories or perform other tasks.</li> 
    <li>Git commands always start with git and are used to save and track versions of your code.</li>
    <li>Using Git commands, we can initiate (or create) a repo, add our code to the repo, and view the different versions of our code, which are each stored in a unique commit.</li>
    <li>Git is great for tracking changes locally on your own computer, but to collaborate with others, you need to use another tool, GitHub.</li>
    <li>GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that allows us to keep track of our projects inside repositories that are stored remotely.</li> 
    <li>Using GitHub not only allows us to store our code, but also to easily collaborate with others.</li>

   <h5>JavaScript</h5>
   <ul>
    <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
    <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
    <li>JavaScript is the tool that takes a static HTML/CSS webpage and makes it interactive</li>
    <li>Variables are containers that store values. You start by declaring a variable with the let keyword, followed by the name you give to the variable: let myVariable;</li>
    <li>JavaScript is case sensitive. This means myVariable is not the same as myvariable. If you have problems in your code, check the case</li>
    <li>After declaring a variable, you can give it a value: myVariable = 'Bob';</li>
    <li>Also, you can do both these operations on the same line: let myVariable = 'Bob';</li>
    <li>You retrieve the value by calling the variable name: myVariable;</li>
    <li>Variables are necessary to do anything interesting in programming. If values couldn't change, then you couldn't do anything dynamic</li>
    <li>Comments are snippets of text that can be added along with code. The browser ignores text marked as comments. You can write comments in JavaScript just as you can in CSS</li>
    <li>An operator is a mathematical symbol that produces a result based on two values (or variables)</li>
    <li>Conditionals are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not. A very common form of conditionals is the if...else statement.</li>
    <li>Functions are a way of packaging functionality that you wish to reuse. It's possible to define a body of code as a function that executes when you call the function name in your code. This is a good alternative to repeatedly writing the same code. </li>
    <li>Functions often take arguments: bits of data they need to do their job. Arguments go inside the parentheses, separated by commas if there is more than one argument.</li>
    <li>Objects (collections of properties) - In computer science, an object is a value in memory which is possibly referenced by an identifier.</li>
    <li>In JavaScript, objects can be seen as a collection of properties. With the object literal syntax, a limited set of properties are initialized; then properties can be added and removed.</li>
    <li>Property values can be values of any type, including other objects, which enables building complex data structures.</li>
    <li>Properties are identified using key values. A key value is either a String value or a Symbol value.</li>
    <li>Arrays are regular objects for which there is a particular relationship between integer-keyed properties and the length property.</li>
      <li>Additionally, arrays inherit from Array.prototype, which provides to them a handful of convenient methods to manipulate arrays. </li>
